### Overall Grade: 160/180

### Quality of report: 10/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? 

    Yes
  
-   Is the final report in a human readable format html? 

    No. No html format in main branch. `-5`.
  
-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (R markdown) for better reproducibility?

    Yes
  
-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report? 

    Yes
  
### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: 105/120

- Q1 (10/10)

- Q2 (10/10)

- Q3 (20/20)

    Dr. Zhou used semi-join but yours appears to be the same. Perhaps line 164 is unnecessary if you use semi-join.

- Q4 (10/10)

    Same here with semi-join

- Q5 (12.5/20)

    This isn't right. You are taking the first lab event disregarding which type it is. We want the first lab event for each type of event, i.e. group_by(subject_id, item_id) on line 377. Then we would have multiple rows per person, each row being a unique item_id. Then we would use pivot_wider() to make it one row per person, one column per item_id. `-7.5`.

- Q6 (12.5/20)

    Same as Q5. On line 488 `-7.5.

- Q7 (20/20)

    Dr. Zhou used left_join here, but I am unable to assess whether you are correct using inner_join.
  
- Q8 (10/10)

	    
### Usage of Git: 10/10

-   Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?

    Yes
  
-   Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 
          
    Yes
  
-   Is the hw2 submission tagged? 

    Yes
  
-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 
  
    Yes
  
-   Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control. If any unnecessary files are in Git, take 5 points off.

### Reproducibility: 10/10

This HW might be difficult to check reproducibility. 

-   Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? Just click the `knit` button will produce the final `html` on teaching server? 

    Yes
  
-   If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

### R code style: 20/20

Each violation takes 2 points off, until all 20 points are depleted.

-   [Rule 2.5](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#long-lines) The maximum line length is 80 characters.  

-   [Rule 2.4.1](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#indenting) When indenting your code, use two spaces.  

-   [Rule 2.2.4](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#infix-operators) Place spaces around all infix operators (=, +, -, &lt;-, etc.).  

-   [Rule 2.2.1.](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#commas) Do not place a space before a comma, but always place one after a comma.  

-   [Rule 2.2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#parentheses) Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets. Place a space before left parenthesis, except in a function call.
