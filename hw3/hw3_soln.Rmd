Load database libraries and the tidyverse frontend:

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dbplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate))
library(DBI)
library(bigrquery)
```

## Q1. Compile the ICU cohort in HW2 from the Google BigQuery database 

Below is an outline of steps.

1. Load the service account token.
```{r}
# path to the service account token 
if (Sys.info()[["nodename"]] == "biostat-203b-teaching-server") {
  # on teaching server
  satoken <- "/mnt/mimiciv/1.0/biostat-203b-2022winter-3fdc2392ac39.json"
} else {
  # on my own Mac laptop
  satoken <- "/Users/huazhou/Documents/github.com/ucla-biostat-203b/2022winter/hw/hw3/biostat-203b-2022winter-3fdc2392ac39.json"
}
# BigQuery authentication using service account
bq_auth(
  path = satoken,
  # email = "mimiciv-bigquery@biostat-203b-2022winter.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  # scopes = c("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery",
  #   "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform")
)
```

1. Connect to BigQuery database `mimic4_v1_0_203b` in GCP (Google Cloud Platform), using the billing account `biostat-203b-2022winter`.
```{r}
# Connect to the BigQuery database `biostat-203b-2022winter.mimic4_v1_0_203b`
con <- dbConnect(
    bigrquery::bigquery(),
    project = "biostat-203b-2022winter",
    dataset = "mimic4_v1_0_203b",
    billing = "biostat-203b-2022winter"
)
con
```

2. List all tables in the `mimic4_v1_0_203b` database.
```{r}
dbListTables(con)
```

3. Connect to the `icustays` table.
```{r}
# full ICU stays table
icustays_tble <- tbl(con, "icustays") %>%
  show_query() %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```

We only keep the first ICU stay. Following code is kind of a hack, using the `summarise_all(min)` function. It seems that `slice_min()`, `slice_head()`, `distinct(, .keep_all = TRUE)` don't work with `dbplyr`+`bigrquery` at the moment.
```{r}
icustays_tble <- icustays_tble %>% 
  select(subject_id, intime) %>% 
  group_by(subject_id) %>% 
  summarise_all(min) %>%
  left_join(icustays_tble, by = c("subject_id", "intime")) %>%
  show_query() %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```


4. Connect to the `admissions` table and only keep the patients who have a match in `icustays_tble` (according to `subject_id` and `hadm_id`).
```{r}
admissions_tble <- tbl(con, "admissions") %>%
  show_query() %>%
  left_join(y = icustays_tble, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id"))

admissions_tble %>% 
  print(width = Inf)
```

5. Connect to the `patients` table and only keep the patients who have a match in `icustays_tble` (according to `subject_id`).
```{r}
patients_tble <- tbl(con, "patients") %>%
  show_query() %>% 
  left_join(y = icustays_tble, by = "subject_id")

patients_tble %>% 
  print(width = Inf)

```

6. Connect to the `labevents` table and retrieve a subset that only contain subjects who appear in `icustays_tble` and the lab items listed in HW2. 
```{r}
labs_of_interest <-(c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 50882, 
                      51221, 51301, 50931, 50960, 50893))

labitems_tble <- tbl(con, "d_labitems") %>%  
  select(1, 2) %>% 
  filter(itemid %in% labs_of_interest) 

labevents_tble <- tbl(con, "labevents") %>%
  inner_join(y = labitems_tble, by = "itemid") %>% 
  select(-labevent_id, -specimen_id, -value, -comments) %>% 
  filter(itemid %in% labs_of_interest) %>% 
  left_join(y = icustays_tble, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>% 
  filter(charttime >= intime & charttime <= outtime) %>% 
  show_query() 

labevents_tble %>% 
  print(width = Inf)

rm(labs_of_interest)
rm(labitems_tble)
```

Only keep the first lab measurements during ICU stay and pivot lab items to become variables/columns.
```{r}
labevents_tble <- labevents_tble %>%  
  group_by(subject_id, itemid) %>%
  summarise_all(min) %>%
  select(subject_id, itemid, hadm_id, intime ) %>% 
  inner_join(labevents_tble, by = c("subject_id", 
                                    "itemid", "hadm_id", "intime")) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "itemid", 
              values_from = "valuenum", names_prefix = "lab") %>% 
  show_query() 

labevents_tble %>% 
  print(width = Inf)
```

7. Connect to `chartevents` table and retrieve a subset that only contain subjects who appear in `icustays_tble` and the chart events listed in HW2.
```{r}
vitals_of_interest <- c(220045, 220181, 220179, 223761, 220210)
vitals_items <- tbl(con, "d_items") %>% 
  select(1, 2, 3, 5, 6) %>% 
  filter(itemid %in% vitals_of_interest)

chartevents_tble <- tbl(con, "chartevents") %>%
  inner_join(y = vitals_items, by = "itemid") %>% 
  select(-storetime, -value, - label, -unitname) %>% 
  left_join(y = icustays_tble, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "stay_id")) %>% 
  show_query() 
  
chartevents_tble %>% 
  print(width = Inf)

vitals_items %>% 
  print(width = Inf)

rm(vitals_items)
rm(vitals_of_interest)
```

Only keep the first chart events during ICU stay and pivot chart events to become variables/columns.
```{r}
# # TODO
chartevents_tble <- chartevents_tble %>%  
  group_by(subject_id, itemid) %>%
  summarise_all(min) %>%
  select(subject_id, itemid, hadm_id, intime ) %>% 
  inner_join(chartevents_tble, by = c("subject_id", 
                                    "itemid", "hadm_id", "intime")) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "itemid", 
              values_from = "valuenum", names_prefix = "vitals") %>% 
  show_query() 

chartevents_tble %>% 
  print(width = Inf)
```

8. Put things together. This step is similar to Q7 of HW2. Using one chain of pipes `%>%` to perform following data wrangling steps: (i) start with the `icustays_tble` for the first ICU stay of each unique patient, (ii) merge in admissions and patients tables, (iii) keep adults only (age at admission >= 18), (iv) merge in the labevents and chartevents tables, (v) create an indicator for 30-day mortality, (vi) save the final tibble to an `icu_cohort.rds` R data file in the `mimiciv_shiny` folder.

```{r}
# make a directory mimiciv_shiny
if (!dir.exists("mimiciv_shiny")) {
  dir.create("mimiciv_shiny")
}
```

```{r}
# since admissions_tble & icustays_tble have already been merged, skipping that 
icu_cohort <- admissions_tble %>% 
  left_join(patients_tble, 
     by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "intime", "stay_id", "first_careunit", 
            "last_careunit", "outtime", "los")) %>%
  filter(anchor_age>=18) %>% 
  left_join(labevents_tble, 
     by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "intime", "stay_id", 
            "first_careunit", "last_careunit", "outtime", "los")) %>%
  left_join(chartevents_tble, 
    by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "intime","charttime", "stay_id", 
           "first_careunit", "last_careunit", "outtime", "los")) %>% 
  filter(charttime>= intime & charttime <= outtime)
  # %>% 
  # mutate(mortalityDay = 
  #          ifelse(is.na(dod), 35*24*3600, dod - admittime)) %>% 
  # mutate(thirty_day_mort = mortalityDay<=(30*24*3600)) %>% 
  # select(-mortalityDay)

icu_cohort %>% 
  print(width = Inf)

icu_cohort %>% 
  collect() %>% 
  write_rds(file = "mimiciv_shiny/icu_cohort.rds")
```

Close database connection and clear workspace.
```{r, eval=F}
dbDisconnect(con)
rm(list = ls())
```

## Q2. Shiny app

Develop a Shiny app for exploring the ICU cohort data created in Q1. The app should reside in the `mimiciv_shiny` folder. The app should provide easy access to the graphical and numerical summaries of variables (demographics, lab measurements, vitals) in the ICU cohort.

Please see `app.R` in the `mimiciv_shiny` folder.
